#2010, Mike Dentith et al., Ground penetrating radar as a means of studying palaeofault scarps in a deeply weathered terrain, southwestern Western Australia

However, the vast majority of the possible palaeoscarps has not been studied in detail on the ground, and it is possible that landforms resulting from other
processes could have been mistaken for palaeofault scarps.

This contribution presents the results of a test of the utility of ground penetrating radar (GPR) in the SWSZ to determine whether proposed palaeoscarps are of seismic origin.Data recorded across one
historic fault scarp (Meckering) and two confirmed palaeofault scarps (Hyden and Dumbleyung), see Fig. 1 for locations, are used to assess the usefulness of this method for confirming the existence of a
palaeofault scarp by determining which aspects of these features give recognisable responses. Also of interest is assessing the usefulness of GPR surveys as a means for positioning trenches for palaeoseismic
studies.
